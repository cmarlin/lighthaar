* rgb-yuv conversion in fixed point 4096, using shift instead of divide
* rewrite vertical filter pass to be cache friendly
* do some kind of radix sort for coef removing:
  - precompute max coeff
  - use a fixed-size table (64k entries ?)
  - add each pixel(+coeff?) to appropriate entry
  - clear pixels until coef clearing reached
* look at others coef computing/clearing methods
* eye is more sensible
  - to dark values than to light ones
  - to low changes than to high ones (from dark to light changing +200 to +150 is not a big mistake)
  use this parameter to adjust qualtification
* update config dialog:
  - I frame rate
  - quality
* Every resolutions
* clean sources:
  - bitmap types
  - custom memory allocation
  - pre allocate every memory
  - allocate enough memory for RL0 and AE coding
  - move codec for custom file
  - split user/internal headers
* yuy2 etc... modes
* sqrt(2) check
* fix logs still appears


Later:
* A/RGB modes (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_Scalable_Texture_Compression modes)
* yuyv, ... input modes
* lossless mode
* CDF 9/7
* think about HDR modes ? (z videos ?)
* delta frame noise fix
* CDF 5/3 fix
* resolution: switch copy for delta
* uint/ushort encoding ?
* multiframe batch encoding 3D

Look for documentation
* motion vectors
